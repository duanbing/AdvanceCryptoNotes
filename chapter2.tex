\subsection{Pedersen Commitment on Secret share}

A commitment schema is cryptographic primitive that allows one to commit to a chosen value whole keep it hidden to others, with the ability to reveal the committed value later.

Pedersen Commitment is introduced firstly in \cite{pedersen1991non} aiming to verify someone(verifier) has received correct information about the secret without talking with other persons(prover).

Given two public and large primes p and q such that q | p - 1, and generator g of the order-q subgroup $G \in  Z_p^{*}$, given two random $a, r \in Z_q$, we have that in order to commit to a message $m \in Z_q$, we just have to compute the commitment
\begin{equation}
c = g^m h^r (mod\ p), where\ h = g^a(mod\ p) 
\end{equation}

Then, to open the commitment, we need values m and r to be revealed, so that the receiver can verify the commitment.    This is the original protocol in  \cite{pedersen1991non}.
